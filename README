Written in ruby, god process monitoring is extendable.
I've tried to intergrate god with collectd and other external services.
These extensions can be included from any god config.
They enhance the default 0.11.0 version.
This is work in (slow) progress.

These extensions also contain two patches.
- driver_clear_events_patch.rb makes sure lifecycle events dont get erased
  in a state change
- cpu_usage_patch.rb alters the SlashProcPoller to average the cpu usage
  over the polling interval, instead of over the process lifetime
